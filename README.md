A children's book

Congratulations!  
Today is their day.  
They're off to Great Places!  
They're off and away

You have brains in your head.  
You have feet in your shoes.  
You can steer yourself any direction you choose.  
You're on your own.  
And you know what you know.  
And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.
