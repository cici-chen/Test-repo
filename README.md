A children's book

Congratulations to myself!  
Today is my day.  
I'm off to Great Places!  
I'm off and away

I have brains in my head.  
I have feet in my shoes.  
I can steer myself any direction I choose.  

I'm on my own.  
And I know what I know.  
And I am the guy who'll decide where to go.
